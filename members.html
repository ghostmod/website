I have used linux based servers (or vps's) for the past 3-4 years. Also have experience with windows servers. I have been modding the ioquake3 source (for urt) for about 3 years. I have been using github for awhile now, and know how to use it fairly well. I currently dont have alot going on which gives me time to mess about with programming related projects.

The types of projects that are fun to me right now are making PHP communicate with servers(urban terror, minecraft, ect.) I just recently started learning so I don't have very much experience, but I never give up on any project once I've started it.   About myself: I am 18 years old, soon to be 19. I play Urban Terror just about every day. I am available on irc all the time and I am also available to speak on mumble/teamspeak/ect. </td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Yes</td><td>I do not have a github page. All I have really made are plugins for an open source IRC bot that I downloaded called noxbot. Right now I make him query urban terror servers to return information. I am working on making him do other things but it is taking some time. </td><td></td></tr>

I know C/C++, PHP, SQL, Javascript, HTML/CSS and Perl, lately I've been using PHP/mySQL to develop my clan website (http://urbanterror.co/wip/), which is kindly hosted by Nikki. When our domain expires for clanwip.com, we will have it assigned to the new website, which is currently maintained through wordpress (I fucking hate wordpress).
